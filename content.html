        <h1>Solar Production At Lovely Professional University</h1>
        <p>Lovely Professional University has installed almost 1000 KW of Solar Panels that caters to the electricity requirements of hundreds of young minds. The solar panels are installed amidst the lush-green campus and act as a powerful and positive impact on the environment.
        Lovely Professional University has installed almost 100 MW of Solar Panels amidst its beautiful lush-green campus that caters to the electricity requirements of hundreds of young minds. The solar power plant in LPU has been established in 2013 and is situated on the roof top of the Uni-Polis, and many other academic blocks. It consists of near about 7500 panels

        <h1>Solar on Streets of New York</h1>
        <p>There are various types of solar street infrastructure, including solar-powered street lights, solar-powered traffic signals, and solar-powered surveillance cameras. Solar-powered street lights are becoming increasingly popular in many cities, as they offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional street lighting. These lights use solar panels to collect energy during the day, which is then stored in batteries and used to power the lights at night.

            Similarly, solar-powered traffic signals use solar panels to collect energy during the day and store it in batteries. This energy is then used to power the signals at night, reducing the need for grid power.
            
            Solar-powered surveillance cameras are also becoming more common on city streets, as they offer a reliable and sustainable way to monitor public spaces. These cameras use solar panels to collect energy during the day, which is then used to power the camera and its associated equipment.

        <h1>Dubai Solar Farms</h1>
        <p>Solar energy can be used to generate heat for a wide variety of industrial applications, including water desalination, enhanced oil recovery, food processing, chemical production, and mineral processing, among many others1. Industries such as agriculture, poultry and dairy farms utilize a lot of electricity and have big roof spaces ideal for a solar panel system2. Existing industries are using solar power to complement grid power & reduce electricity bills, adopt sustainable manufacturing practices and conserve energy3.
            Dubai has a number of solar farms and has recently made significant investments in solar energy. One of them is Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is situated in Dubai and is one of the biggest solar parks in the world1. It will minimise yearly carbon emissions by more than 6.5 million tonnes and have a capacity of 5,000 Megawatts by 2030.

                <p>Transparent solar cells (TSCs) are emerging devices that combine the benefits of visible transparency and light-to-electricity conversion. Currently, existing TSCs depend dominatingly on organics, dyes, and perovskites; however, the rigidity and color-tinted transparent nature of those devices strongly limit the utility of the resulting TSCs for real-world applications.</p>

                <p>I was hesitant to invest in solar panels at first, but this company made the process so easy and stress-free. They answered all of my questions and helped me choose the best option for my home. Now that I have the panels installed, I couldn't be happier. The energy savings are impressive, and I feel good knowing that I'm doing my part to help the environment."</p>
